I am currently learning to code with <href> Code First Girls</href>. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
  </p>
HTML is cool
CSS is cooler
JS is the best
  <br>
What do you need to create a website?
<p>Not much!
<ul>A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS </ul>
</p>
